## Description

This is an HTML password generator. It creates a randomized password based on user-inputed parameters, being the password length, and options of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Upon receiving this information, it will generate a password and return it to the user.

## Credits

I used a template provided by my UCI bootcamp, and was assisted by an AskBCS Learning Assistant, Google's Bard AI tool, and my class study group.
